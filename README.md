# Rust AVL Trees
This is an implementation of AVL trees in rust. It currently only features insert and look up of `u64` keys and arbitrary
values. You should not be using this unless you know what you are doing, as I only write it to get to know programming in rust. REPEAT: This is not a serious library, just a test project.
